*FAQs*

* If a treaty is cancelled or close, can we assign the same under a treaty group - it doesn't matter treaty is cancelled or closed or active, it should not be an issue for treaty assignment. Also, treaty assignment rule doesn't mention anything about this restriction so it should be fine.

Here is the rule for treaty assignment to group period:

* Purpose of Transaction /MSG/R_ADR: Under this transaction we can take print of statement of account (SOA) related to a treaty group of type print group “({color:#ff991f}or for an individual treaty as well - this is only FYI as we are now only worried about treaty group{color})”.

*I want to* call an OData service of SAP RM for accounting related configuration

*So that* I am able to provide CBC services to create accounts.

 +*Goal of our customer*+

* A client which wants to use SAP Reinsurance Management OData services and built own UIs needs the respective CBC services. The scope of this epic is to develop the missing CBC services to create accounts and postings. 

+*Note*+

These CBC services will be provided to version 8.7 only. No downport to earlier version(s).

*Compare the linked excel for details*

*In General*

All services must be implemented according to SAP specifications (e. g. naming conventions based on global field name catalog) and also based on the msg internal specifications (see [+Webansicht+|https://msggroup.sharepoint.com/sites/TEA-RI-Products/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FTEA-RI-Products%2FSiteAssets%2FReinsurance%20Products%20Notebook&wd=target%28Knowledge%20and%20How%20To%27s.one%7C4FED1063-C757-422E-B82A-AD3CC01FFD3B%2FRAP%20Development%7CEA754599-7AA3-4331-9AAF-0714CBFA525E%2F%29])

The RAP Model uses different View levels that have to be implemented for each new ODATA service: 

# Database

# Basic Views

# RAP I View

# RAP C View

# ODATA Service

all ODATAs must be documented in all relevant documents (e. g. Security Guide, User Guide, Release Notes, SAP Business Accelerator [https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/resource/Email_Address|https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/resource/Email_Address|smart-link] )

Security Standards from SAP must be fulfilled.

FAQs:

13 August 2025

# There are some CBC fields (total 6) wherein requirement has been marked Business Object, what does this mean?

   >> From the CBC accounting topic perspective, we should first focus on the priority one and two and the business objects we look at later in because they are on the treaty, for example, the section and the involvement number. There may already be some services existing which can read part of the treaty. So we don't need to do anything new there, so we should for now ignore these.

Business Object: Means, *it's not really configuration, but it's an application data*. So these fields belong either to risk manager participations or to treaty fields. So that's why PP wrote the business object because we probably have to do business object modelling for them if they don't exist.

# Do we need separate service for each field or we can have all fields under one service?

   >> We need to create one service for each field if they are of different type from each other.

# Is any field depended on the other field (input parameters)?

   >> If we build a service later on where we can create accounts and postings, there will be dependencies between these fields. But since we only create services to read the configuration, we do not need to worry currently about the dependencies between the fields. Because that would be kind of a service which then is allowing us to create an account, change an account, add postings, and that's kind of stuff. The current asked to do is that we create the customizing services which are independent from anything. Once we use these configuration services within, for example an Odata service to create accounts, there will be dependencies between the fields but this needs to be defined then in that account creation, account update Odata service.

# What is the difference between these GUID, ORIG_GUID, BR_GUID fields? 

   >> GUID: Participation to which the account belongs to
ORIG_GUID: The Original participation provides the participation to which the initial source account was posted. Assume we have Intercompany retrocession through company code chains in RM. The account started on participation A in company code 1, was there retroceded to participation B and participation B is linked to company code 2 and in Company Code 2 we have retrocession in 2 to participation C

Account A1 is posted to part A has all three GUIDs referencing A

Account A1 is transferred to part B which creates account A2
GUID: B, ORIG_GUID = BR_GUID = A

Account A2 is transferred to part C as account A3:
GUID = C, BR_GUID = B, ORIG_GUID=A

*ODATA services that transfers detailed information about S4 (FS-RI, SAP) some configurations*:
