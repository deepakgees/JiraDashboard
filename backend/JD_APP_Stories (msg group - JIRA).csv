Notes for treaty group deletion:

* If the status of the treaty group as “posting allowed”, it cannot be deleted. Otherwise, it can be deleted.
* When group period is active, it should not allow deletion of treaties assigned in that period. It can be done at “In Progress” status.
* When the treaty group is deleted, it should be “marked for deletion” not actual delete from database.
* If we have any assignments like periods, and the treaties assigned in that period and if we are deleting the group header directly, we should not delete the assignments from the database, and the soft delete should happen for the Group Header.
* If the treaty assigned to the group is deleted, it should be deleted on database level also. Similar for group period as well.
* Unit tests must be created.

* Create group header where treaty and its corresponding validation check can be added.
* Create group periods: group start date, group end date, status, checks, i.e. posting allowed, canceled, reason for change
* For the group assignment, there are two required fields: the treaty number and the section number.
* All sections of a single treaty number must be assigned to the same print group number.
* Create Print Group header with all features (refer to excel)
* Authorization check for Print Group needs to be added - The MR project colleagues need a list of checks that are executed in the service in order to be able to integrate such checks in the UI.
* Only treaty group will be created
* History will be created

Description

*As a* developer,

*I would like* to create Treaty Group of type Forecast and Estimation

*So that* I can bundle treaties to do prognosis of future premiums, claims, and expenses.

+*Scope*++:+

* Create group number (internal and external) which should fetch company code, description, group category, i.e. Forecast and Estimation
* Create group header where treaty and its corresponding validation check can be added
* Create group period header: group start date, group end date, status, checks, i.e. posting allowed, canceled, reason for change
* Create Forecast and Estimation header with all features (refer to excel)
* Authorization check for F&E needs to be added - The MR project colleagues need a list of checks that are executed in the service in order to be able to integrate such checks in the UI.
* Only treaty group will be created
* History will be created
* When OData service is invoked with a valid treaty group information then it should be able to create a treaty group with F&E and return a treaty group number along with the passed information.
* If we would like to create treaty group with invalid value, it should return with an error.
* Unit tests should be created for the OData services

*Reason for Change group*
This service has the field ReinsurTreatyStatCategory which references a additional configuration. I would expect that the service return at least the description in addition to the code. It is a similar discussion we had with Anand last week for the estimation indicator and the field resolve.
 
*Treaty group category*
ReinsurExtname - Should not be available because it is my understanding that in OData we do not address Extension service
ReinsurTreatyAcctgFrqcy - Description for the accounting frequency should be available
 
for the following fields, I personally would have choosen a different name:
      ""ReinsurGroupEstimateDataId""  - ReinsurGroupIsEstimateGrp

*I want to* understand technical requirement of this epic

*So that* I can break into smaller user stories that can be delivered to the customer.

*Action:* Table update for accounting related CBC under the sheet attached in the topic.

*Analysis/work result:*

We have to provide several read-only services, that return all fields (e. g. ID, Short, Long description and inactive Flag) for each specific configuration (exception Create and Change data are not returned). Therefore, we have created OData APIs for the following Accounting CBC services and have tested them. The results are as expected:

For the following configurations separate ODATA services are needed.

* {color:#36b37e}Origin Indicator for an Account/Payment{color} --> SAP_RI_MGMT-68653
* {color:#36b37e}Account Status{color} --> SAP_RI_MGMT-68654
* {color:#36b37e}Business Type No.{color} --> SAP_RI_MGMT-68654
* {color:#ff5630}Module That Created the Account{color} - 23 Oct 2025: PP advised, since the values in that table are not all related to accounts and we currently are not sure if a value from this table is required in an Odata service as an input or output, we decided to not create a CBC service for this in the msg namespace and wait till we know what information we would need for an Odata service from this table and then build a service once we know. --> SAP_RI_MGMT-68654
